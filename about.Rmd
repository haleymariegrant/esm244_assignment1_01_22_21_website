### Interests

In my graduate study I focus on the role that economies and governments play regarding climate change. I am interested in market interventions and North American environments. 

I like to be outside hiking, running, and surfing. 

### Projects

My master's group project looks at the possible benefits of a "pay-for-performance" loan product for farms who reduce water and fertilizer use. 

Our work is helping limit aquifer overdraft and reduce nitrate contamination in California's groundwater.
