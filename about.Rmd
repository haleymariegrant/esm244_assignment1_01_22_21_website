### Interests

In my graduate study I focus on the role that economies and governments play in preventing and contributing to climate change. I am interested in market interventions and North American environments. 

I like to be outside hiking, running, and surfing. 

### Projects

My master's group project looks at how agricultural lending can reward environmental stewardship, specifically through loans that include favorable terms for growers who reduce water and fertilizer use. 

Our project is working with the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) to help California reduce aquifer overdraft.
